# Python-project
The project required data cleaning and manipulations, various analysis and corresponding visualizations to be made on the unicorn dataset provided.
These are some of the steps I took in my project;
Data Inspection and Manipulation by checking the shape of the data, checking the columns, checking the data types, checking the information about the data, checking and visualizing missing values. 
I performed basic exploratory data analysis by importing the required libraries (numpy, panda, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot...), loading the data file of the project, codings and visualizations.
I had some challenges in expanding the x-axis label values as sometimes, the categorical values and numerical values that were in billions or millions were many and had to be cramped up, hence displaying unclear values. Sometimes, I encountered challenges in removing the urrency sign and billion/million symbols on numerical values.
